<h1>Steps: </h1>
<p>To start off begin by prepping all the needed ingredients so this way we can just put the lasagna together after the noodles are boiled (if you are using ones that need to be). Put ground beef in a medium sized pot and cook until browned; then add in your tomato sauce and tomatoes to finish off he meat sauce. While meat is browning, mince up your onion and set aside. Then take the garlic clove and crush it, setting it aside also. </p>
<p><strong>If using noodles that don't need to be boiled skip to step 2.</strong></p>
<p> Bring one large pot of water to boil with some salt in it. After it starts boiling place in your lasagna noodles and add some oil to prevent them from sticking together. At the same time take your ground beef and cook it until its all nice and browned, turn off the heat and wait for the noodles to finish. Once they are finished boiling strain them in a colander. Now we get to the fun part. </p>
<h2> Assembly</h2>
<p>In a 10 inch or larger baking pan, put a layer of noodles and then top them with the Ricotta, after that you'll put another layer of noodles and add in your meat sauce. I like to do 2 layers of each on my lasagna but that's personal preference. After you finish your last layer, to it with some sauce and mozzarella cheese. Now you are ready to throw it in the oven. </p>
<h2>Time to cook!</h2>
<p> Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Cover the lasagna with aluminium foil, and place in the oven for 25 minutes. After the first 25 minutes, take the aluminium foil off of it and place it back in for another 25 minutes. Take out of the oven and let sit for 10 minutes before serving.
